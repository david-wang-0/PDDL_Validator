 
- Define datatypes and synonyms for domains, problems, etc.
    - [ ] ~~Primitive types can be changed from wrappers around strings to some sum type~~
    - [x] Should PDDL_Atom really have a type parameter?
        - Yes, because initial assignments are predicates of object, while formulas have atoms of term
        - PDDL_FORMULAS do not need a parameter
- Implement conversion from ML types to Isabelle types
    - [x] Is there some existing function that converts strings to rational numbers?
    - [ ] Prove conversion to rationals correct
    - [ ] Implement a function to combine conditional effect lists
    - [x]The assignment must be disambiguated after the function declarations have been parsed and proven well-formed.
        - This can be assumed, since the domain and problem declarations must habe been proven well-formed by the time action schemas are converted.
    - Domain declarations
    - Problem declarations
    - Domain
    - Problem
