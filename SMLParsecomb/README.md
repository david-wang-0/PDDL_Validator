parcom -- a parser combinator library

This is a simple parser combinator library based on code by Chris
Okasaki, Robert Harper, Frank Pfenning and Tom Murphy VII, with
utility modules inspired by Haskell's parsec library and some error
reporting added.

Currently it uses their stream and file position implementation: this
should be removed once we get a proper extended standard library.
